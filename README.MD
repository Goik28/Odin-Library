# Library

- This is my take on the "Library" project from "The Odin Project" course, Javascript path, after I refactored it to use ReactJS and integrate it with Google's Firebase.
- For this project to work, it's needed to add a firebase-configuration file to root.
- The old version was branched (old-main) and has a live version: [HERE](https://goik28.github.io/Odin-Library).

## The Objective

- To create a library app that user could keep track of their book's list and update the reading status of them.
- To use Firebase Auth to allow access only to identified users.
- To use Firebase Firestore to persist the individual library data and allow only their owner access to read and modify that data.

## To improve

- Write tests for the functions and for the react user flow.
- Better style the application.
